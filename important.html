<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">There 
  are many players out there with a clan tag equal or similar to [KiF] which nonetheless 
  aren't members of this clan KiF.<br>
  In addition there are names of KiF members which were given up and are not in 
  use any more but still popping up in some statistics around the web. (Perhaps 
  their low scores were the reason for starting up with a new name, na-HA! na-HAHA!)<br>
  What follows is pretty obvious: Only players with an entry in the members section 
  of this site are members of this clan.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Another 
  tag which is sometimes in use by clan KiF is (A) which is used only for the 
  following two reasons:<br>
  - a member-to-be still in his/her 'apprentice' phase<br>
  - a player not intending to join clan KiF but playing together with KiF members 
  in a session, clan match, etc.<br>
  A player using this tag might </font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">turn 
  up as [KiF]Stone (A).<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">Various 
  other tags can be used to express a certain role or state of mind. These tags 
  have always the form (ws'('{ASCII}*')')*. For example [KiF]Ciske (OS) (Boarder).</font></p>
