This guide will show you all needed steps to setup your config/buyscripts etc in CS2.

### Path for client config files ###

CS2 looks for config files in this folder (if you installed it on drive "C:")

  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg"

Please be aware that a very similar path exists without "game" in it!!!

WRONG: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg"

Correct: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg"


### sample cfg ###

Download this file and put it into the exact folder mentioned above.


### tbd ###



Note that you can execute script files anytime by opening the game's console and typing

    exec <config-file-name>
