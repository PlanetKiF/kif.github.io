Run first, shoot later: a really hard habit to break but hey, let's not try to teach an old dog new tricks. So I play enthusiastically and aim for the title "Enemy of hearts" (which really is something that should be added to the endgame titles).

Remember  when you could spray your very own logo in Counter Strike? Those where the days...
