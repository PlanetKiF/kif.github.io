title: "Configuring the Game Server"

There are more then 3000 variables to configure the client and server behavior  of CS:GO. Here we try to give you a basic understanding of how configuration works and how we configured our server. 

## Basic Information ##

GS:GO can be configured using
- launch commands or options 
- the `autoexec.cfg` file which is executed when the server is started
- the `server.cfg` file which is executed when a new map is started 
- the `gamemode_xxx.cfg` and `gamemode_xxx_server.cfg` files which are executed when a new map is started (and after the `server.cfg`)

There are of course lots of other files managing the game's behavior but so far we have only changed the bot configuration file `botprofile.db`.

All the config files need to be placed in the folder `~/csgosv/csgo/cfg/`
